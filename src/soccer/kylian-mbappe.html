                            Paris St-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe has stated that he hasn't made a definitive decision
                            regarding his future. The <span>25-year-old France captain's contract</span> with the Ligue 1 champions
                            is set to <span>expire in the summer</span>, leading to intense speculation <span>linking him with a move to
                            Real Madrid</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mbappe, <span>after informing PSG in June</span> about not opting for an additional 12 months in his
                            contract, addressed the matter saying, "First of all, I'm very, very, very motivated for
                            this year. It's very important."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following his <span>goal-scoring performance for PSG</span> in their 2-0 victory over Toulouse to secure
                            the <span>French Champions Trophy</span>, he continued, "As I said, we've got titles to go after and
                            we've already won one, so that's already done. After that, no, <span>I haven't made up my mind
                            yet</span>."
                        </p>
                        <p>div>
                            Mbappe clarified, "But in any case, with the agreement I made with the chairman [Nasser
                            Al-Khelaifi] this summer, it doesn't matter what I decide. <span>We managed to protect all parties
                            and preserve the club's serenity</span> for the challenges ahead, which remains <span>the most important
                            thing</span>. So we'll say it's secondary."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The forward, who initially joined PSG on loan from Monaco in 2017 before a <span>record-breaking
                            180m euro ($197.2m)</span> move, was slated to depart on a <span>free transfer at the end of the 2021-22
                            season</span>. However, he eventually signed a two-year contract extension, with the option for an
                            additional year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, after declining the additional year, <span>Mbappe wasn't part of PSG's pre-season tour to
                            Japan</span>. He also declined to meet with representatives from <span>Al-Hilal, who made a world record
                            $329m</span> offer for him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Following "very constructive and positive" talks</span>, Mbappe returned to first-team training, as
                            stated by PSG. Reflecting on his decision-making process, Mbappe mentioned, "If I know what
                            I want to do, why drag it out? It just doesn't make sense."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, <span>Barcelona manager Xavi</span> acknowledged that players like Mbappe are <span>beyond the
                            Catalan club's financial reach at present</span>. "Unfortunately, we are not in a privileged
                            situation economically to do that. I am left with the players I have, and with those players
                            we have to win," said Xavi.
